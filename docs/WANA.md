# Tech structure
- [ ] global state via react hooks (user, GA, etc)
- [ ] form validation via react hooks
- [ ] retrive META tags before page render (do we need this for every page?)
- [ ] title for each pages (retrive via drupal or hardcode + generate for product pages?)
- [ ] navigation hardcoded
- [ ] dynamic routes (how to add new article/content?)
- [ ] snapshot tests only for stateless components
- [ ] unit tests for custom hooks
- [ ] elastic search (seems hard, try to go there as late as possible, lots of things in drupal around this functionality)
- [ ] vehicle taxonomy (cap data) (similar, but simpler then elastic, some cron jobs, etc)
- [x] pm2 usage
- [ ] add release tags
